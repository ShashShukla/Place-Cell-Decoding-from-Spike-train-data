# Place-Cell-Decoding-from-Spike-train-data

Code for the course project for EE638-Estimation and Identification, IIT Bombay, 2018.

An Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been implemented to decoded the spatial location of a rat given spike-train recordings from place cells in the rat's brain. A Sequential Importance Resampling Particle Filter (SIR-PF) was also implemented and used to successfully decode the rat's location.

Run the IEKF by simply typing "python iekf.py" in the terminal, and the SIR-PF by typing "python sir_pf.py".
