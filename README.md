# Place-Cell-Decoding-from-Spike-train-data

Code for the course project for EE638-Estimation and Identification, IIT Bombay, 2018.
An Iterated Extended Kalman Filter has been implemented to decoded the spatial location of a rat given spike-train recordings from place cells in the rat's brain.
Run the code by simply typing "python iekf.py" in the terminal.
